     * New authentication for the user won't be possible for this time. <br>
     * Reason of the use of this time: <br>
     * A new SSL session will be established by JMX after {@link JmxLoginModule}
     * process. The success of the handshake of that new SSL session should be
     * ignored for authentication check (ie in {@link JmxSslHandshakeListener})
     * because authentication has already been made by {@link JmxLoginModule}. <br>
     * Because we don't know how to link this new SSL session to the authenticated
     * user, we can just ignore new SSL handshake successes for a small period of
     * time: SSL_SUCCESS_IGNORE_TIME milliseconds. That means that any connection
     * attempt with credentials of that user will be refused for that time. <br>
     * If we don't do this, a new SSL handshake success would be saved just after
     * {@link JmxLoginModule} process, and would be kept for
     * {@link #SSL_SUCCESS_EXPIRE_TIME} milliseconds, allowing any user with any
     * trusted certificate to attempt to authenticate with credentials of the
     * processed user. <br>
     * By ignoring the next SSL handshake success of an user after a successful
     * authentication of that user, we reduce the risk of somebody that could
     * authenticate with (username, password) credentials without the client
     * certificate corresponding to the user (with another trusted client
     * certificate). The risk isn't completely gone, it is still possible between
     * time when the SSL handshake success is detected by
     * {@link JmxSslHandshakeListener#handshakeCompleted(HandshakeCompletedEvent)}
     * and time when {@link JmxLoginModule} ends its authentication process.
